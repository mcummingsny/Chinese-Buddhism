<b>Foundations of Chinese Intellectual History II: Chinese Buddhism</b>

The readings here accompany the second part of a series on the intellectual history of China. To access readings for the first part, on the history of Chinese thought prior to the introduction of Buddhism, click on"mcummingsny" in the file path at the top of this page and choose the repository beginning with the words "Chinese Intellectual History."

Buddhist literature is vast and complex; attempting to present a few texts here as a precis of Buddhist thought would be futile at best and misleading at worst. A far better way to become acquainted with Buddhist literature is through the anthologies of translated texts that appear in "CHINESE BUDDHISM_SUGGESTED READINGS" in the list above. The few translations that do appear in this repository are specific to particular issues discussed in the lectures.

This repository is a work in progress.  Check back regularly to find newly added documents.
